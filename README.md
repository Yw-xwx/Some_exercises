>upload two exceptional exercises i have done last week:  
>>`exercise2.c` is about find the order of some strings, like a,b,c,...,z,ab,ac,....,az,bc,bd,...,bz with the idea of recursion;  
>>`exercise5.c` is about find the max distance or gap between two numbers with the algorithm of bucket sorting.  

>And one point about two pointers or double pointers:
>>`double-pointers.c` has 4 problems,which are all originated from the point of two pointers,which optimize the time cost effectively.
